Summary
-------

    Passionate about architecting and delivering advanced digital solutions
    that provide meaningful benefit to human beings.  Experienced in creating
    optimal embedded sensor stacks---especially for atypically-constrained
    systems---by leveraging a multi-disciplinary background designing firmware,
    digital hardware, and platform specifications.


Overview of Technical Skills
----------------------------

    Embedded System Architecture:
        translation of feature requirements into system design, full-stack
        modeling, protocol design, custom silicon specification, silicon
        development-cycle support

    Firmware (C, ASM; ARM (Cortex-A & M), Picoblaze, AVR...):
        core system infrastructure, sensor interface architecture, signal
        processing, power optimization, high-speed communication

    Software (C, Python, Bash, Make...):
        build-system architecture, simulation framework infrastructure,
        interprocessor communications, hardware abstraction

    FPGA Gateware (VHDL, Verilog; Lattice, Altera & Xilinx parts):
        high-speed/high-bandwidth hardware interfaces, real-time signal
        processing, intelligent clock routing, soft-processors


Selected Professional Experience
--------------------------------

    Apple
        July 2013--Present

        Responsible for architecture design, functional specification,
        behavioral modeling, and spearheading team delivery of new embedded
        sensing stack solutions.  Deliverables include scalable firmware
        infrastructure design and implementation, custom silicon specification,
        and system architecture definition.


    Lincoln Lab VI-A Fellowship
        June--August 2011, January 2012--June 2013

        Designed and built a high-speed channel emulator for airborne
        communication networks to complete an M.Eng. fellowship degree in June,
        2013.  Created a digital architecture which interfaced FPGAs with fast,
        high-bandwidth analog hardware in order to apply complex algorithms to
        a signal stream in real-time.  Architected a full-stack framework for
        emulating environmental effects on wireless signals and modeled Doppler
        shifting.


    MITRE Corp. Internship Program
        June--August 2010

        Prototyped hardware encryption concept device and demonstrated it to
        funding authorities.  Wrote and live-tested debug software for an
        aerial communications module.  Built FPGA test framework for a GPS
        hardware interface.


    BAE Systems Internship Program
        June--August 2009

        Designed and implemented FPGA algorithms for sensor defect image
        correction and data corruption detection in military night vision
        goggle.  Modeled and simulated to prove correctness and tested
        implementation on physical hardware.


    MIT Course Staff
        2009--2012

        Lab staff for MIT courses 6.01, 6.004, 6.091, and 6.111.
