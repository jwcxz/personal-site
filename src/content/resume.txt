Summary
-------

    Passionate about architecting and delivering advanced sensing solutions
    that provide meaningful benefit to human beings.  Experienced in
    constructing optimized embedded sensing stacks---especially for
    atypically-constrained systems---by leveraging a multi-disciplinary
    background designing and executing firmware, digital hardware, and platform
    specifications.


Principle Technical Skills
--------------------------

    Embedded System Architecture:
        translation of feature requirements into system design, SoC & sensor
        silicon architecture specification, full-stack modeling, end-to-end
        optimization, interface protocol design

    Firmware (C & ASM, ARM systems):
        core system infrastructure, sensor interface architecture, signal
        processing, power optimization, high-speed communications, hardware
        abstraction, silicon bringup

    Software (C, Python, Make...):
        build-system architecture for multi-target low-level code-bases,
        simulation framework infrastructure, interprocessor communications

    Digital Design for FPGAs (VHDL, Verilog):
        high-bandwidth hardware interfaces, real-time signal processing, CPU
        (Picoblaze, NIOS II) integration & firmware bringup


Selected Professional Experience
--------------------------------

    Apple
        July 2013--Present

        Responsible for architecture design, functional specification,
        behavioral modeling, and spearheading team delivery of new embedded
        sensing stack solutions.  Deliverables include scalable firmware
        infrastructure design and implementation, custom silicon specification,
        and system architecture definition.


    Lincoln Lab VI-A Fellowship
        June--August 2011, January 2012--June 2013

        Designed and built a high-speed channel emulator for airborne
        communication networks to complete an M.Eng. fellowship degree in June,
        2013.  Architected a full-stack solution that interfaced FPGAs with
        high-bandwidth analog hardware and applied real-time algorithms to
        emulate Doppler shifting.


    MITRE Corp. Internship Program
        June--August 2010

        Prototyped hardware encryption concept and demonstrated it to funding
        authorities.  Built test infrastructure for an aerial communications
        module.  Built FPGA test framework for a GPS hardware device.


    BAE Systems Internship Program
        June--August 2009

        Designed, implemented, and validated FPGA algorithms for sensor defect
        image correction and data corruption detection in military night vision
        goggle.


    MIT Course Staff
        2009--2012

        Lab staff for MIT courses 6.01, 6.004, 6.091, and 6.111.
