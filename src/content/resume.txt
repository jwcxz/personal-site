Summary
-------

    Passionate about architecting and delivering advanced digital solutions
    that provide meaningful benefit to human beings.  Experienced in creating
    optimal embedded sensor stacks---especially for atypically-constrained
    systems---by leveraging a multi-disciplinary background designing firmware,
    digital hardware, and platform specifications.

Selected Work Experience
------------------------

    Apple
        July 2013--Present
        Current Position

        Responsible for architecture design, functional specification,
        behavioral modeling, and delivery of new sensor stack solutions.
        Deliverables include scalable firmware infrastructure design and
        implementation, custom silicon specification, and system architecture
        definition.


    Lincoln Lab VI-A Fellowship
        June--August 2011, January 2012--June 2013

        Designed and built a high-speed channel emulator for airborne
        communication networks to complete an M.Eng. fellowship degree in June,
        2013.  Created a digital architecture which interfaced FPGAs with fast,
        high-bandwidth analog hardware in order to apply complex algorithms to
        a signal stream in real-time.  Architected a full-stack framework for
        emulating environmental effects on wireless signals and modeled Doppler
        shifting.


    MITRE Corp. Internship Program
        June--August 2010

        Prototyped hardware encryption concept device and demonstrated it to
        funding authorities.  Wrote and live-tested debug software for an
        aerial communications module.  Built FPGA test framework for a GPS
        hardware interface.


    BAE Systems Internship Program
        June--August 2009

        Designed and implemented FPGA algorithms for sensor defect image
        correction and data corruption detection in military night vision
        goggle.  Modeled and simulated to prove correctness and tested
        implementation on physical hardware.


    Lockheed Martin/Hanscom Air Force Base AFCEA Fellowship
        June--August 2008

        Designed and implemented a prototype solution for managing and
        verifying software licenses.  Developed vulnerability-inspection and
        management add-on for IBM Security Systems.


    MIT Course Staff
        2009--2012

        Lab staff for MIT courses 6.01, 6.004, 6.091, and 6.111.
